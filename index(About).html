    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Ahmad Mirzay, a passionate web developer/ AWS Cloud Engineer. currently enrolled in Per Schols, where I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always eager to learn more about web technologies and anything as it relates to tech.</p>
    <p>My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites are built and designed. Since then, I’ve worked on various projects ranging from simple to advanced. I enjoy the process of turning creative ideas into reality and solving problems through code.</p>
    <p> Outside of coding, I’m interested in meeting new people, voluteering, running, reading, playing sports and many other things, which helps me stay inspired and motivated.</p>
    <p>I’m currently looking for opportunities to further my career and contribute to exciting projects. Feel free to connect with me through my contact page or check out my portfolio to see some of the work I’ve done.
        Thank you come again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
